```

## Project Organization

Organize your documentation using intuitive structures. Choose folders for hierarchical navigation or tags for flexible categorization.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Folders" icon="folder">
    Create nested folders to mirror your project structure.

    ```
    docs/
    ├── introduction.mdx
    ├── api/
    │   └── endpoints.mdx
    └── guides/
        └── quickstart.mdx
    ```

    <Callout kind="tip">
      Drag and drop files to reorganize effortlessly.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Tags" icon="tag">
    Assign tags like `feature`, `bugfix`, or `api` for cross-project filtering.

    Use the tag panel to view all docs tagged `v1.0`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search Functionality

Search across all documents with advanced filters. You query titles, content, tags, or even code snippets.

| Feature          | Description                          | Example Query             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Full-Text Search | Matches words in titles and body     | `authentication flow`     |
| Tag Filter       | Limits results to specific tags      | `tag:api`                 |
| Regex Support    | Advanced pattern matching            | `error.*handler`          |
| Code Search      | Finds code blocks and snippets       | `fetch.*api.example.com`  |

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Tips" default-open="false">
  Combine filters: `project:api AND status:draft`. Exclude with `-tag:deprecated`.
</Expandable>

## Version Control Basics

Track changes with built-in Git integration. You commit, branch, and revert documents like code.

<CodeGroup tabs="Git CLI,UI">
  ```bash
  # Stage and commit changes
  git add docs/features.mdx
  git commit -m "Add search functionality docs"
  git push origin main
  ```
  ```bash
  # Create a branch for new features
  git checkout -b feature/search-ui
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```bash
# Revert to previous version
git checkout HEAD~1 -- docs/introduction.mdx
```

<Callout kind="tip" kind="success">
  Enable auto-commits in settings for seamless version history.
